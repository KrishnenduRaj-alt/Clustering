# Clustering
Customer Segmentation using Clustering Algorithms

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and implementation of various clustering algorithms to perform customer segmentation. The project aims to identify distinct customer groups within a dataset based on their purchasing behavior and demographics.

🚀 Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to apply unsupervised machine learning techniques to uncover natural groupings in customer data. By identifying these segments, a business can develop targeted marketing strategies, improve customer experience, and optimize product offerings.

This project demonstrates proficiency in:

Implementing and comparing different clustering algorithms.

Data preprocessing and feature scaling for distance-based algorithms.

Evaluating the performance of unsupervised models using metrics like the Silhouette Score.

Visualizing high-dimensional data and interpreting the resulting clusters.

Deriving actionable business insights from unlabeled data.

⚙️ Implemented Clustering Algorithms
This analysis explores and compares the following clustering algorithms:

K-Means Clustering: An iterative algorithm that partitions the dataset into a pre-determined number of clusters (K) by minimizing the variance within each cluster.

Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering: A method that builds a hierarchy of clusters, starting with each data point as its own cluster and merging them based on distance. Visualized using a dendrogram.

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): An algorithm that groups together points that are closely packed together, marking as outliers points that lie alone in low-density regions.

📊 Dataset
The project utilizes a synthetic customer dataset containing features such as:

Age

Annual Income

Spending Score (a score assigned based on purchasing behavior)

The objective is to group customers into segments like "high-income, low-spending" or "young, high-spending" without any prior labels.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x

Key Libraries:

Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation.

Scikit-learn for implementing clustering models.

Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization and plotting clusters.

Jupyter Notebook for analysis and presentation.
